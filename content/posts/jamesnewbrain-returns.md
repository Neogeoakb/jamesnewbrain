Summary: hello world-ish post

A lot has happened in the world of blog hosting and web development since I last dabbled in this seven (!) years ago.  I faced a pretty decent learning curve to bring this site up in accordance with what I believe to be some semblance of modern web technologies.

As the hello world post of this here brog, the triumphant return of jamesnewbrain.com (after I forgot to continue to pay for hosting on that wordpress site I was running so many years ago), I offer the following (growing) list of things I love in no particular order **except for number one on the list:**

* Steph
* strong espresso
* programming
* procrastinating on programming projects by thinking about all the different programming projects I *could* be working on right now
